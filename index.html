                    <p>My name is Brad Pitt. I am an actor from Shawnee, Oklahoma, though I now live in Los Angeles like
                        every other actor.
                    <p>I have a wide range of acting skills, from action and thriller to comedy and drama. I am known
                        for playing charismatic male leads, and have been described as the world's most attractive man
                        by several media outlets. Nowadays I prefer subtler roles, including those where I play a father
                        figure, which I am to my six children.</p>
                    <p>Apart from acting, I have experience as a producer for many films with my own production company
                        Plan B Entertainment, of which I am the CEO. In my spare time, I enjoy philantropy,
                        architecture, and skateboarding. In my work with the Make It Right Foundation, I get to combine
                        at least two of these interestsâ€”sometimes all three!</p>
